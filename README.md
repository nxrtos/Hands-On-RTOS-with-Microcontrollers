The original evaluation board used in this project is [NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) from ST.  For peoples who have other boards, we are in progress to port projects to other boards as well. 

At this moment here are the list of boards supported.

-  [NUCLEO-F722ZE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f722ze.html)
- [NUCLEO-F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html)

- [NUCLEO-L452RE-P](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l452re-p.html)
- [NUCLEO-L476RG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html)

The list may add more over the time, a separated file should create to track it.

At this moment the demo projects all use [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) as the development tool.
